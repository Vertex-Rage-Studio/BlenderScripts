# BlenderScripts
A collection of useful Blender scripts that are too small to turn into addon. Might be later converted into an addon with combined functionality.

Mostly related to streamline our processes while developing game assets, but might be useful beyond that.

# Script list:
- `remove_extra_spaces.py` - script that will "clean" selected objects from extra spaces (double spaces, trailing/leading spaces) from both object and mesh names.
- `print_collection_tree.py` - simple script for just printing collections for other uses
- `match_mesh_name.py` - script that matches mesh names to object names
