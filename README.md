# VRS Blender Scripts

This GitHub repository contains a curated set of practical Blender scripts that are not extensive enough to be individual add-ons. The goal is to eventually merge their functionalities into a unified add-on.

The primary focus of these scripts is to streamline game asset development, although they may also be helpful in other contexts. The current script list includes:
- `remove_extra_spaces.py`: Cleans selected objects by removing extra spaces (double spaces, trailing/leading spaces) from both object and mesh names.
- `print_collection_tree.py`: A basic script that prints collection trees for further usage.
- `match_mesh_name.py`: Matches mesh names to their corresponding object names.
